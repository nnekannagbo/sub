    <h2>Game Rules:</h2>

    <p>Friends. Welcome.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of "portal" is to explore the artist's digital universe and collect various items that serve as portals to deeper layers of her creative expression.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player character within the game container.</li>
        <li><strong>Collectibles:</strong> The game features collectible items scattered throughout each level. To collect an item, navigate your player character to it and overlap with it. You will automatically collect the item upon contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Levels:</strong> The game consists of multiple levels, each offering a unique experience and collectibles related to the artist's work. As you progress through the levels, you will uncover more about the artist's creative journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Transition:</strong> After collecting all the items within a level, a new item will appear in the game container. Collecting this item will act as a portal, transporting you to a new webpage or layer of the artist's work. There's no need to click or press any buttons; the transition is automatic.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Take your time to explore the artist's digital world, read her poems, and discover the hidden connections between technology, nature, and personal expression.</li>
        <li><strong>End Goal:</strong> The ultimate objective of "Portal" is to immerse yourself in the artist's perspective, embracing the unique blend of art and technology that defines her creative journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy the Journey:</strong> There are no winners or losers in "Portal." Instead, it's a poetic exploration of digital existence, an invitation to appreciate the beauty and depth that can be found within the online world.</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> As you progress through the game, consider the themes and emotions expressed by the artist. Each level and collectible offers a glimpse into her unique perspective on life, technology, and nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, the green is grass, the yellow are flowers, and the numbers in the middle wiill take you where you need to go. In here, you are listeners, players, readers, and seers. Good luck.</p>
